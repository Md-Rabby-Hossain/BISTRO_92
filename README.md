# BISTRO_92
This project implements a smart ordering system for restaurants using an ESP32. Customers can browse the menu, select items, adjust quantities, and place orders directly from the table via an OLED display. Orders are sent to the kitchen in real-time, improving efficiency, service speed, and customer satisfaction.
